#Computes the probability of a seismic event with magnitude greater than 4.0 assuming that magnitudes are normally distributed 
#with an annual mean of 1.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5. 
#Use Gauss-Legendre quadrature to do this. 
#You may also need to implement equation (17) as a function to do this.
#For a measured distance with mean L = 10.28 m and standard error Î”L=0.05 m, estimate the probability 
#that the true value is between 10.25m and 10.35 m. Use Gauss-Legendre quadrature to do this.
#Plots the convergence of the above estimates using increasing number of integration points in a log-log space.
#Saves the output figures in the directory figures/ in the root of your project folder. 
#You may want to use matplotlib.pyplot.savefig() to save your figures as image files.
