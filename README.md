GOPH 420 Lab 01
W2024
Instructor: Brandon Karchewski
Author: Arvin Karpiah

Lab 01: The purpose of this lab is to examine algorithms for performing numerical
integration of functions represented by both discrete data samples and in cases where
the function to be integrated is available

All .py files to be run can be found at src/goph420_lab01 including driver_seismic and driver_probability

Apologies for not putting the driver files in an example folder. I couldnt call the integration.py function from a separate folder.
